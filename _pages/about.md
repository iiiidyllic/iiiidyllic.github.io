<div class="about-content" markdown="1">

I am currently a **PhD student** at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/yinfeng). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BEng degree in Intelligent Manufacturing from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/).

I aim to develop unified frameworks for intelligence that can autonomously learn, reason, and adapt across diverse modalities and evolving environments, bridging perception, cognition, and action toward truly general and embodied AI. With this aim, my research focused on:

- **Causal inference** for robust, interpretable learning in dynamic, non-stationary environments;
- **Cross-modal alignment** to enable language-guided interaction and semantic world modeling;
- **Representative learning** for abstraction, transfer, and open-ended generalization across diverse tasks.

If you are interested in collaborating or discussing research ideas, feel free to reach out via [my email](zihaoliu1@link.cuhk.edu.cn).
